### 👋 Hi there! I’m **Caleb Rubalema** — Software & DevOps Engineer 🚀

- 🛠 I build tech solutions that **save time, money, and lives** — from streamlining hospital systems to automating DevOps workflows.
- ⚙️ Love playing with **Python**, **Java**, **React**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and anything that makes systems **fast, reliable, and secure**.
- 📦 Reduced processing times by **90%**, improved customer support response by **50%**, and cut cloud costs by **90%**.
- 🌍 Passionate about **open source** — I’m always down to collaborate and contribute to projects that make the world better.
- 📚 Currently diving into the world of **Machine Learning** and dreaming up my next hack.
- 🎹 When I’m not coding, I’m probably playing a tune on the piano or brainstorming the next big idea.
