👋 Hi there! I’m Caleb Rubalema — Software & DevOps Engineer 🚀
	•	🛠 I build tech solutions that save time, money, and lives — from streamlining hospital systems to automating DevOps workflows.
	•	⚙️ Love playing with Python, Java, React, Docker, Kubernetes, and anything that makes systems fast, reliable, and secure.
	•	📦 Reduced processing times by 90%, improved customer support response by 50%, and cut cloud costs by 90%.
	•	🌍 Passionate about open source — I’m always down to collaborate and contribute to projects that make the world better.
	•	📚 Currently diving into the world of Machine Learning and dreaming up my next hack.
	•	🎹 When I’m not coding, I’m probably playing a tune on the Guitar or brainstorming the next big idea.
